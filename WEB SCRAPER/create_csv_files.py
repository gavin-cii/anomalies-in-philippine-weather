import csv


####CREATES CSV FILES, one for data, one to list how many temp entries per date
##Remember if you run this after you have scraped the pages it will write over that data so you will have to start over

with open('temps.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Date','Time','Temperature','Dew Point','Humidity','Wind','Wind Speed','Wind Gust','Pressure','Precip.','Condition'])

with open('NumEntries.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Date','Len'])
